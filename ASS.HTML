            <h1>1.HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT</h1>
            <p>JAVASCRIPPT Ia a cross-platforms, Object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages inter-active.</p>
            <p>*-JavaScript was created at Netscape communicatiion by BRENDAN EICH in 1995.</p>
            <p>*-Javascript is the world's most popular programming language.</p>
            <p>*-JavaScript is the programming language of the web.</p>
            <p>BRENDAN EICH developed javascript, a computer language,in just TEN DAYS in MAY 1995. Initially called MOCHA,then LIVESCRIPT,it finally became known as JAVASCRIPT.
            <br>it was designed for the client-side of websites to add dynamic and inter-active elements to static HTML pages.</p>
            <p>JAVASCRIPT was first implemented in NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR,the most popular browser at the time.</p>

                    <td>The scope of a Var variable is functional or global scope</td>
                    <td>It can be updated and re-declared in the same scope.</td>
                    <td>It can be declared without initialization. </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>The scope of a Let variable is block scope.</td>
                    <td>It can be updated but cannot be declared in the same scope</td>
                    <td>It can be declared without Initialization.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>The scope of a Const Variable is block scope</td>
                    <td>It can neither be updated or re-declared in any scope.</td>
                    <td>It cannot be declared without initialization.</td>
                </tr>
                <h2>When to Use Let and Const.</h2>
                <p>Var can be tricky because its scope is either global or within a function, which can lead to bugs. To avoid these issues:</p>
                <p>*Use Let when you know a variable's value might change later in your code.</p>
                <p>*Use Const for variables that should never change once you set them.</p>
                <p>Using LET and CONST makes your code easier to understand and helps prevent errors caused by unexpected variable changes.</p>
